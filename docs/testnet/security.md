## Conduct Survey on General Controls of Hosting Data Centre

Perform a survey on the hosting data centre, and compare your result with the best practice suggested below

For example, your hosting data centre should have following features

| Controls Category | Description of Best Practice    |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Data Center       | Redundant Power                 |
| Data Center       | Redundant Cooling               |
| Data Center       | Redundant Networking            |
| Data Center       | Physical Cage/Gated Access      |
| Data Center       | Remote Alerting Security Camera |

## Current Status of Node Setup

Perform a survey on your current status of node setup, and compare your result with the best practice suggested below

For internal communication channels between nodes, they should be set with specific source and destination addresses. For internet reachable nodes, set TCP 26656 to be the only incoming port, if possible. |
