# Remix

Set up a Remix Ethermint local development environment. {synopsis}

## Pre-requisite Readings

- [Installation](./../../quickstart/installation.md) {prereq}
- [Run a node](./../../quickstart/run_node.md) {prereq}
- [Metamask](./../wallets/metamask.md) {prereq}

[Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) is an in-browser IDE for [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) smart contracts. In this guide, we will learn how to deploy a contract to a running Ethermint network through Remix and interact with it.

## Connect Ethermint account to Remix

First, follow the steps in the [Metamask guide](./../wallets/metamask.md) to import your Ethermint private key into Metamask. Start the Ethermint daemon and rest server.

Once that is complete, go to [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/). There are some contracts in the File Explorer. Select any of these contracts.  In this example, we use `Counter.sol` from the [Truffle](./truffle.md) guide. On the left-most bar, select the Solidity Compiler and compile the contract.

Next, select the `Deploy and Run` option. Select `injected web3` as the environment. This will open a metamask popup for you to confirm connecting your Metamask to Remix. Hit confirm.

You should see your account show up in the left-hand panel.

## Deploy and Interact

Now that your account is connected, you are able to deploy the contract. Press the `Deploy` button. A metamask pop-up will appear asking you to confirm.  Confirm the transaction.  You should see a log for the deployment transaction in the ethermint daemon logs:

```bash
I[2020-07-15|17:26:43.155] Added good transaction                       module=mempool tx=877A8E6600FA27EC2B2362719274314977B243671DC4E5F8796ED97FFC0CBE42 res="&{CheckTx:log:\"[]\" gas_wanted:121193 }" height=31 total=1
```

Once the contract has been successfully deployed, you will see it show up in the `Deployed Contracts` section in the left-hand side, as well as a green check in the Remix console showing the transaction details.

Now, you are able to interact with the contract through Remix. For `Counter.sol`, click `add`. This will open a Metamask pop-up asking you to confirm. Confirm the transaction. Then, click `getCounter` to get the count, which should be `1`.
