                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                      description: >-
                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {

                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                      type: string

                        Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above

                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:
        - name: msg.data.type_url
          description: >-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
            serialized

            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical
            form

            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that
            they

            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
            the

            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
            type

            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

            type.googleapis.com.


            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON


                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

          Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

          Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON


          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
              }

          A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
          serialized

          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

          the fully qualified name of the type (as in

          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical
          form

          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that
          they

          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
          the

          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
            value in binary format, or produce an error.
          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
            breaking changes.)

          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

          type.googleapis.com.


          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

          used with implementation specific semantics.

    description: >-
      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with
      a

      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any;
          any.PackFrom(foo);
          ...
          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
            ...
          }

      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
          ...
          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
          }

      Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

          foo = Foo(...)
          any = Any()
          any.Pack(foo)
          ...
          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
            any.Unpack(foo)
            ...

      Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
           if err != nil {
             ...
           }
           ...
           foo := &pb.Foo{}
           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
             ...
           }

      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

      name "y.z".



      JSON


      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

          package google.profile;
          message Person {
            string first_name = 1;
            string last_name = 2;
          }

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
            "firstName": <string>,
            "lastName": <string>
          }

      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

      representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
            "value": "1.212s"
          }

                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON


            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                  "value": "1.212s"
                }
